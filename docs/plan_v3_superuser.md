# V3 — the reshared incubator superuser prototype

**Source:** `docs/prototype/source/incubator/AISJ_SuperuserV3.HTM` (1,001,779 bytes, shared 2026-09-19).
It supersedes `AISJ_IC_SuserV15.HTM` **for the superuser role only** — the admin, program-manager,
program-associate and jury prototypes were NOT reshared.

**Scope:** incubator, superuser first (the client's words). Nineteen change items, listed in §3.

---

## 1. Two traps that hid ~40% of this work. Read before you scope anything.

**(a) The admin console is base64.** `var ADMIN_B64="PCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw+..."` is decoded at runtime
into an iframe `srcdoc` (`atob` → `TextDecoder` → `f.srcdoc`). **A plain grep of the outer file returns
ZERO hits for everything inside it** — Scoring framework, Composite formula, AI weight, Price
configuration, Team & roles, and the two new sections. Scoping this release with grep alone reported
"no prototype backing" for six client items that have the *most precise* backing on the list.

    python3 docs/prototype/tools/decode-embedded.py \
      docs/prototype/source/incubator/AISJ_SuperuserV3.HTM  <outdir>

Decoded: **v3 210,144 bytes vs v15 174,399 — +36 KB, the largest delta in the release.**
This is the second time this trap has been hit here (see the `startup-jury-admin-console-gap` note).

**(b) `panel-settings` is the last panel in the file.** Any "from this id to the next id" extent
measurement swallows every trailing `<script>` and reports a false +74 KB. The settings panel is
**unreachable in BOTH versions** — `showPanel('settings')` occurs 0 times in v15 and 0 times in v3;
`si-settings` → `openSetup()` → the 4-step setup wizard. It is not new and it is not the headline.

**Measured deltas that ARE real** (panel markup only, boundaries checked):
`alldecks +1006` · `evaluate +533` · `introcalls +410` (CSS only) · `coreparams −13` ·
`jurypipeline −34` · `query −78` · `upload −2136` · `assign ±0 (byte-identical)` ·
**decoded admin console +35,745**.

## 2. The sidebar, which reframes three client items

| | v15 | v3 |
|---|---|---|
| Workflows | All decks | **Dashboard** (`ti-layout-dashboard`) |
| Evaluation | Upload · Query · **Evaluate** · Assign · Jury Pipeline · Prog manager pipeline · Intro calls · … | **Upload & Evaluate** · Query · Assign · Jury Pipeline · **Intro calls** · **Prog manager pipeline** · … |

Three consequences the client's list does not state:
- **There is no standalone `Evaluate` sidebar item in v3.** So "shift Query after Evaluate" is already
  satisfied: Query sits directly after *Upload & Evaluate*. Zero-cost.
- **`Intro calls` and `Prog manager pipeline` swapped order.** Not on the client's list at all.
- **The Evaluate screen is orphaned.** `showPanel('evaluate')` appears once, inside `upSendToEvaluate()`,
  which has no callers. We are asked to redevelop a screen the prototype gives no way to reach (§4, Q6).

## 3. Coverage of the client's 19 items

Legend — **BUILD**: evidenced, buildable. **DECIDE**: prototype and instruction disagree. **ASK**: needs
a corrected file or a number. **MEASURE**: prototype unchanged, so the gap is in our build and unmeasured.

| # | Item | State | Evidence / why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Eval report consistent at each stage | **DECIDE** | v3 **deletes** stage-awareness: `__introCols`, `__jTot` and the `__roleBlock` stage switch are gone; colspan hard-coded 5. That reverses **W7-D and Issue 24**, which are server-enforced (`decks.ts` `reportLayout(edition, stage, role)`). |
| 2 | Jury pipeline status repeating | **BUILD** | Cleanest item. Markup diff is one line: `-<th>Status</th>`. The repeat was the row pill *plus* the per-juror `jp-jstat` pills. Action options drop 5→2 (Send to intro calls · Reassign/add jury), then the cell becomes a flow tag. |
| 3 | Composite formula: hide all but weighted average | **DECIDE** | Console still offers all three, byte-identical to v15. Client marked it *Workaround* — an explicit override of "match the prototype exactly". Record it or the next parity audit reverts it. |
| 4 | AI weight: hide all but 50/50 | **DECIDE** | Console offers 40/30/50/0 and **has no `selected` attribute, so 40% AI · 60% Jury is the effective default** — and `migrations/0026` agrees (`ai_weight_pct DEFAULT 40`). Keeping only 50/50 **silently re-weights every existing org's composite.** Needs a yes/no on re-scoring. |
| 5 | Decks >24 MB not opening | **ASK** | Both prototypes say `Max 50 MB`, byte-identical — a **pre-existing** gap, not a v3 change. `MAX_PDF_BYTES = 24 MB` is arithmetic, not arbitrary: ×1.333 base64 ≈ the 32 MB model-input cap. Raising the constant alone makes uploads succeed and **evaluations fail** — strictly worse. Needs the target number and a streaming/Files-API plan. |
| 6 | Assign: only "Evaluated & Complete" | **DECIDE** | `panel-assign` is **byte-identical** (md5 `b555211d…`), the assign renderers diff to zero lines, and the string occurs **0 times in either file**. v3 still draws the Incomplete drawer. We are asked to delete UI the reshared prototype still ships. |
| 7 | Query: only "Evaluated & Incomplete" | **DECIDE** | Same class. `panel-query`'s entire diff is one deleted select-all checkbox; the renderer is byte-identical and `qRenderList` filters nothing. The string occurs 0 times. |
| 8 | Upload → "Upload & Evaluate", redev | **ASK** | The redev is mostly a **deletion**: `#up-results` is gone and the footer collapses to one button — which is literally `showPanel('alldecks')` — while the screen still promises *"You approve → Credits deducted"*. Worse, a richer inline results card has **CSS and ~110 lines of JS but no markup**; `renderUpResults([0,3,5,7])` runs at load into a swallowed `catch`. **Likely a broken export — ask for a corrected file.** |
| 9 | Query after Evaluate in sidebar | **BUILD** | Already satisfied by §2. Zero-cost. |
| 10 | Evaluate page redev | **BUILD + DECIDE entry** | +533 B: new `AI Evaluate` toolbar button, select-all + "N selected" in column 1, sub-line *"evaluated decks move to the Assign screen"*. `evAiEvaluate()` → toast → `showPanel('assign')`. But the screen has no entry point (§2). |
| 11 | Core Parameters: AI prompts per seat | **BUILD** (console) | In the decoded console: Area-weights header `<th>Type</th>` → `<th>AI prompt</th>`, every one of the 13 rows gains an `AI prompt` button, plus `Restore all core AI prompts`. "prompt" occurs **91× in admin-v3 vs 7× in admin-v15**. Note the outer `panel-coreparams` drops `Type` *without* adding the column — the two surfaces disagree. |
| 12 | Configurability toggles under Area Weights | **BUILD** (console) | New: `Seat configurability` card, columns `Parameter set · Standard · Pro · Premium`, rows `Core parameters` / `Addl. parameters`. Defaults stated: *Standard — none · Pro — core only · Premium — core + additional.* It is an **edit permission**, not per-tier prompt content. |
| 13 | Visibility of other's evaluations | **BUILD** (console) — highest risk | New `Visibility for Incubator` (4×4) and `Visibility for VC` (5×5) matrices, *"Viewer (row) → can see scores of (column)"*. Footnote: *"Super User & Program Manager see everyone; Program Associate and Jury Member see no one — jury members cannot see each other (blind evaluation) until turned on here."* **This is the `role-boundary-leaks` class — enforce server-side, negative control mandatory.** |
| 14 | Intro calls scheduling flow | **MEASURE** | `panel-introcalls` is +410 B of **CSS only** (jury-pipeline flow-tag styles), and all 16 `nc*` functions are **byte-identical**. The client is right that our flow diverges — but from **v15**. This is a build defect nobody has measured. |
| 15 | Price config control panel | **BUILD** (console) | Rebuilt from an iframe into an inline section: `Paid trial`, `Individual plans — ₹ per period`, `Enterprise plans — ₹ annual`, and `Save & apply to My Account`. |
| 16 | Setup → Team & Roles realigned | **BUILD** | Wizard step 4 becomes *Nominate your super user*; the add-member block is deleted (−45 lines) and replaced by a handoff card to **Team & roles**, which gains an inline add-member form. |
| 17 | My account → Pricing revisited | **MEASURE** | The account overlay grew 56,019 → 71,008 bytes (**517 diff lines, unread**). It is item 15's other end: `prSave()` → `postMessage({type:'aisjPricing'})` → `acRefreshPricing()`. Do not let anyone estimate this without reading it. |
| 18 | All decks → "Dashboard" | **BUILD** | Verbatim. Superuser-only per the client, so use `labelOverrides`, not `label`. |
| 19 | Dashboard stat boxes + screens | **BUILD + DECIDE** | Six boxes, new order/labels/colours: Uploaded · AI Evaluated · Not AI Evaluated · Incomplete · **Archived** · Shortlisted. **`Assigned` is deleted — reversing Aug-2026 issue 4**, which is quoted in `deckStats.ts:166-167`. Tables collapse 4 shapes → 2. Archived is excluded from every other count, so the tile **denominator changes**. |

## 4. Decisions required before code is written

Four of these are *"delete something the client previously asked us to build"*.

- **Q1 — Stage-aware reports (item 1).** v3 deletes what W7-D and Issue 24 built, server-side included.
  Does "consistent at each stage" mean *identical everywhere* (delete `reportStage.ts` and the server's
  `stage` parameter), or *same visual design, stage-appropriate content*? These are very different builds.
- **Q2 — AI weight default (item 4).** Hiding all but 50/50 moves the effective default from 40/60.
  Do existing cohorts re-score, or is 50/50 new-orgs-only?
- **Q3 — Composite formula / AI weight (items 3, 4).** Confirm these override "match the prototype exactly".
- **Q4 — Assign & Query filters (items 6, 7).** The prototype contradicts both. Give the rule in words
  (which stages, which statuses), and confirm the Assign *Incomplete* drawer is to be removed.
- **Q5 — Upload results screen (item 8).** Is the inline results card real markup we did not receive, or
  is the single `Evaluate & Go to Dashboard →` button the whole design? Credits are deducted here.
- **Q6 — Evaluate entry point (item 10).** The screen is orphaned in v3. Where is it reached from?
- **Q7 — Assigned stat box (item 19).** Deleting it reverses Aug-2026 issue 4. Confirm.
- **Q8 — Upload size (item 5).** Target ceiling, and acceptance that >24 MB decks cannot be AI-evaluated
  without a streaming/Files-API change.

---

## 5. Build order (what blocks what)

1. **`nav.ts`, one commit, first.** Items 8, 9, 10, 18 all edit one array. Superuser-only
   `labelOverrides`, or `parity:nav` grows gaps against the four role prototypes that were *not* reshared.
   **In the same commit**, register `AISJ_SuperuserV3.HTM` and re-point `scripts/parity-lib.ts` — until
   then every change made from v3 registers as a *new* parity gap.
2. **Item 1 (report) before 2, 10, 19.** `EvaluationReportModal` has **9 call sites** across seven screens,
   and every one of those screens is edited by another item. Settle the shared leaf first.
3. **Item 15 before 17** (pricing producer before consumer). **Item 16 before any other wizard edit**
   (step 4 is deleted wholesale). **Item 11 before 12** (prompts must exist to be gated).
   **Item 10 before 6** (`evAiEvaluate` is what makes Assign post-evaluation).
4. **Item 5 last**, and only with the streaming work.

## 6. Files touched by more than one item

| File | Items |
|---|---|
| `src/shared/nav.ts` | 8, 9, 10, 18 — four items, one array |
| `src/server/routes/decks.ts` | 1, 5, 13, 19 — **the most dangerous file here** |
| `src/client/components/EvaluationReport.tsx` | 1, read by 2, 10, 19 via 9 call sites |
| `src/client/routes/admin/ScoringFramework.tsx` | 3, 4, 13 |
| `src/client/routes/admin/AreaWeights.tsx` | 11, 12 |
| the admin console registry | 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 |
| `src/client/routes/DashboardPage.tsx` | 1, 18, 19 |
| `UploadPage.tsx` + `upload/**` | 5, 8 — **and shared with the VC edition, which was not rescoped** |
| `e2e/parity.spec.ts` | 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 18, 19 |
